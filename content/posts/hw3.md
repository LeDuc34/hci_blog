# Lecture 7: Ideation - Enhancing Human Abilities with Augmented Reality

**Project**: Enhancing human abilities in the age of augmented reality  
**Focus**: AR Skill Overlay for manual task learning

---

## Problem Statement

Learning a new manual task can be frustrating and intimidating. Video tutorials require constant back-and-forth between the screen and the task, paper instructions lack clarity, and it's difficult to know in real-time whether you're doing things correctly.

**Proposed Solution**: An AR system that overlays visual instructions directly onto the real environment, guiding the user step-by-step with contextual overlays.

---

## Idea 1: Beginner Mode - Detailed Guidance

### Concept
Complete AR interface for users discovering a task for the first time. Each action is broken down into micro-steps with maximum contextual information.

### Features
- **Animated highlighted zones**: Precise visual indication of where to act (cyan pulsation)
- **Complete text instructions**: Each step explained in detail
- **Tips and tricks**: Professional tips displayed in real-time
- **Duration indicators**: Timer for each step
- **Progress validation**: Checkpoints to confirm before moving to the next step
- **Safety alerts**: Warnings for critical steps

### Application example: French press coffee preparation
```
Steps covered:
1. Boil water (500ml, 93°C)
2. Add ground coffee (30g, coarse grind)
3. Pour water in circular motion
4. Stir gently (3-4 times)
5. Let steep (4 minutes)
6. Press plunger slowly
7. Serve immediately
```

### Advantages
✅ Accessible to complete beginners  
✅ Reduces mistakes and frustration  
✅ Builds confidence gradually  
✅ Comprehensive learning  

### Disadvantages
❌ Can be overwhelming for some users  
❌ Less efficient for experienced users  
❌ Lots of on-screen information  

---

## Idea 2: Expert Mode - Minimalist Interface

### Concept
Streamlined version for users who already have basic knowledge. AR simply displays key points and critical measurements without over-explaining.

### Features
- **Minimal indicators**: Only essential information
- **Precise measurements**: Temperatures, quantities, timing
- **No highlighted zones**: User knows where to act
- **Quick navigation**: Ability to skip steps
- **Hands-free mode**: Voice or gesture control
- **Customization**: User chooses which info to display

### Use case
Ideal for:
- Cooks who know the basics but want precise measurements
- Mechanics who only need technical specs
- Artisans who just want safety reminders

### Advantages
✅ Non-intrusive interface  
✅ Leaves autonomy to the user  
✅ Suited for regular users  

### Disadvantages
❌ Insufficient for true beginners  
❌ Risk of missing important steps

## Idea 3: AR Skill Overlay Multi-Tasks - Advanced Cooking

### Concept
AR application for more complex cooking tasks requiring multiple simultaneous skills. Focus on professional onion cutting as an example.

### Specific Features
- **3D cutting grid**: Projection of optimal cutting lines
- **Knife angle**: Real-time tilt indicator
- **Finger position detection**: Safety alerts if fingers too close
- **Recommended speed**: Visual metronome for cutting rhythm
- **Multiple cutting styles**: Julienne, brunoise, mincing, etc.
- **Real-time comparison**: Overlay comparing your work to a professional chef

### Difficulty levels
1. **Beginner**: Simple quarter cuts
2. **Intermediate**: Fine slicing
3. **Advanced**: Brunoise (3mm cubes)
4. **Chef**: Julienne and decorative cuts

### Extended applications
- Cutting various vegetables (peppers, carrots, herbs)
- Fish filleting
- Meat cutting
- Dough folding (croissants, gyoza)

### Advantages
✅ Develops precise technical skills  
✅ Immediate quality feedback  
✅ Gamified progression  
✅ Enhanced safety  

### Disadvantages
❌ Requires precise depth sensors  
❌ More technically complex  
❌ Initial calibration required

## Final Choice for Prototyping

**I selected Idea 1 (Beginner Mode - Detailed Guidance)** for the following reasons:

1. **Technical feasibility**: Easier to prototype with Wizard of Oz or paper prototype
2. **Immediate impact**: Solves a clear and universal problem
3. **Ease of evaluation**: Testers will easily understand and interact
4. **Concrete use case**: Coffee preparation = familiar task with nuances
