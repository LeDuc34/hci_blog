# Homework 2

## Lecture 4

![Dr. Young-Ho Kim](/images/kim.jpg)

Dr. Young-Ho Kim is a Research Scientist at NAVER AI Lab leading the Human-Computer Interaction Research Group. His work focuses on an important area of HCI that bridges personal wellbeing and artificial intelligence.

### Current Research Focus

Dr. Kim designs, develops, and evaluates Personal Informatics technologies that help people better understand themselves and make positive behavioral changes. His recent work is particularly timely and impactful: he's investigating how to leverage generative AI in Personal Informatics systems to address the lifelong challenges faced by marginalized populations.

### Recent Achievements

Dr. Kim has been remarkably productive and recognized in the field:

- Eight papers were conditionally accepted to CHI 2025, with five authored by research interns from his group
- He received Best Paper Awards at CHI 2025 for AACessTalk and at CHI 2023 for CareCall
- He also received Honorable Mention Awards at CHI 2025 for Textoshop and CHI 2021 for DataAtHand

### Notable Projects

Some of his recent projects demonstrate his commitment to accessibility and inclusive design:

- **AutiHero**: Leveraging generative AI in social narratives to engage parents in story-driven behavioral guidance for autistic children
- **AACessTalk**: Fostering communication between minimally verbal autistic children and parents with contextual guidance and card recommendations
- **ExploreSelf**: Using large language models to provide adaptive guidance for user-driven exploration and reflection on personal challenges

His work exemplifies how modern HCI research combines cutting-edge AI technology with human-centered design to create meaningful impact for underserved communities.

## Lecture 5: Sutherland's Predictions - 60 Years Later

### Already Achieved ✅

**Display & Interfaces:**
- Color area-filling displays → modern screens
- Keyboard as primary input → ubiquitous
- Direct manipulation (drag-and-drop) → modern GUIs
- Stylus and pointers → mouse, trackpads, Apple Pencil

**Advanced Technology:**
- Force feedback joysticks → flight simulators, game controllers
- Eye tracking → modern VR headsets (Vision Pro, Quest Pro)
- Breaking physics rules → video games, scientific simulations

### Not Yet Achieved 🔮

**The Ultimate Display:**

A room where the computer controls the existence of matter:
- A virtual chair you can actually sit on
- Handcuffs that truly confine
- A bullet that would be fatal

**Future Paths:**
- VR/AR with full-body haptics
- Direct brain-computer interfaces
- Programmable matter / nanotechnology
- Tactile holograms

### Key Insight 💡

**In 1965**, Sutherland predicted nearly everything we use today.

**His ultimate vision** (Star Trek's Holodeck) remains our technological horizon.

**The question**: Will we get there through perfect sensory illusion or actual matter manipulation?

**What's most striking**: He understood computers aren't just for calculation, but for letting us **experience concepts impossible in the physical world**. That's exactly our reality today.

## Lecture 6: Microsoft

**What it was:** A motion-sensing input device for Xbox that let you control games and navigate menus using body movements and voice commands, eliminating the need for a traditional controller.

### Why It Failed

1. **Forced bundling** - Microsoft required the Kinect with every Xbox One at launch (2013), adding $100 to the console price. This made Xbox One $499 vs PlayStation 4's $399, significantly hurting sales.

2. **Limited compelling content** - Most Kinect games were casual/fitness titles. Core gamers (Xbox's main audience) wanted traditional controller-based games, not motion controls.

3. **Technical limitations** - Kinect worked best in large, well-lit rooms. Many gamers had smaller spaces or lighting issues that made the experience frustrating.

4. **Accuracy issues** - The motion sensing wasn't precise enough for serious gaming. Voice commands were inconsistent.

5. **Privacy concerns** - An always-on camera/microphone in your living room made many users uncomfortable.

Microsoft discontinued Kinect in 2017, though the technology found second life in fields like robotics, healthcare, and the Azure Kinect developer kit. It's a classic case of innovative technology that couldn't find the right market fit—too ambitious for gaming, but valuable elsewhere.
