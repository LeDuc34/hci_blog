# Homework 1

## Affordances

### Bad Example: Numlock Button

An example of bad affordance is the numlock button on my laptop's keyboard.

The problem is that I can't see if the num lock is activated or not. A way to improve this design would be to add a small LED indicator to inform the user about the current mode.

### Good Example: Gym Authentication System

A good design I've found in my daily life is the authentication system at my gym. To enter the gym, you need to show your badge and place your index finger on a detector to verify that the fingerprint matches the badge owner.

While it might seem excessive, it's actually quite fast and not very demanding for users. It effectively solves the problem of badge sharing between members—with this design, it's quite difficult to defraud the system.

## Gestalt Laws

### Digital Example

We can see that the content below the Lecture's points is not clearly marked as belonging to the Lecture section. To improve this design, we could add indentation to the content and make the font size smaller to create a better visual hierarchy.

### Physical Example: Light Switches

A physical example where gestalt principles went wrong is with the light switches in my apartment. It's difficult to figure out which switch controls which light if you're not familiar with the layout. The design is not intuitive and lacks clear visual grouping.

## Dark Design Patterns

An example of dark design I have found is with the API platform of OpenAI (similar behaviors can be found with other companies such as Anthropic, Google, etc.).

You can see that I have a negative balance. This is problematic because I didn't authorize this overage—I think it's misleading. A more user-friendly approach would be to stop the inference before the amount is exceeded, or at least make this an option for users who want to avoid unexpected charges.
