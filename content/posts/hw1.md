# Homework 1

## Affordances

### Bad one
An example of bad affordance is the numlock button on my laptop's keyboard.

Indeed i can't see if the num lock is activated or not.
A way to improve could be to add a little led to inform the user about the current mod. 
### Good one

A good design I've found in my daily life is the way to authentificated to my gym.
To enter in the gym, you need to show the badge and put your index on a detector to see if the fingerprint matches with the badge owner. \
It seems a bit too much but infact it is quite fast :  not very demanding for the users. \
It solve the problem of badge sharing between users : with this design is quite diffcult to defraud.

## Gestalt Laws

### Digital

\
We can see that the content below the Lectures's points is not marked as belonging to the Lecture. \
To improve that we could add a tabulation to the content and make the police smaller for example.

### Physical

A physical example where it went wrong is with *switches*.\
In my appartement it's difficult to find which switch control which light if you are not used to. It is not intuitive.

## Dark Design Patterns

A example of dark design I have found is with the API plateform of OPENAI. \
(we can find similar behaviours with others companies such as Anthropic, Google ...)

You can see that i have a negative balance. This is problematic because i did not pay for that, I think its a bit missleading. \
Instead of that, I think stopping the inference before the amount is exceeded would be more fair for the users. At least this should be an option.
