## LECTURE 10: The Shape of Smartphones

### The Evolution

**Early Era (2000-2007):** Physical keyboards dominated. Think BlackBerry and Nokia - thick devices with tiny screens because typing mattered more than viewing.

**iPhone Revolution (2007-2010):** The shift to full touchscreen killed the keyboard. The 3.5-inch slab design became standard as content consumption replaced communication as the primary use.

**Screen Size Wars (2010-2017):** Displays grew from 4" to 6"+. Devices got thinner. Video streaming and social media demanded bigger screens.

**Bezel Elimination (2017-Present):** Edge-to-edge displays with notches and punch-holes maximized screen real estate. Glass-sandwich designs became universal.

### Why Shapes Changed

- **Technology improved**: Better batteries, efficient processors, flexible displays
- **User behavior shifted**: From communication device to multimedia consumption tool
- **Manufacturing evolved**: Better materials, precision engineering
- **Market pressure**: Differentiation through design
- **Ergonomics**: Balancing screen size with usability

### What's Next?

**My prediction: Adaptive form factors through foldables and flexible displays.**

**Why this makes sense:**

1. **Technology is ready**: Foldables exist (Samsung Fold, Huawei Mate X) but expensive. Prices will drop as manufacturing scales.

2. **Solves the paradox**: People want large screens AND portable devices. Foldables deliver both.

3. **Multiple use cases**: Pocket-sized when folded, tablet-sized when open.

4. **Material science progress**: Ultra-thin glass, flexible OLED, and durable hinges improve rapidly.

**Long-term (10-15 years):**

- **Rollable screens** that extend from pen-sized devices
- **Wearable computing** integrated into glasses/clothing
- **Shape-shifting materials** that physically morph based on use
- **Ambient computing interfaces** using any surface as a display through AR

## LECTURE 11: The Computer for the 21st Century

### Weiser's Vision (1991)

Mark Weiser imagined a world where **"specialized elements of hardware and software will be so ubiquitous that no one will notice their presence."**

**Core Concepts:**

**Embodied Virtuality**: Bring computing into the physical world, not force humans into virtual worlds.

**Three Device Types:**

- **Tabs** (inch-scale): Wearable devices, hundreds per room
- **Pads** (foot-scale): Paper-like computers you grab and use anywhere, dozens per room
- **Boards** (yard-scale): Wall-sized displays, one or two per room

**Three Waves of Computing:**

1. Many people, one computer (mainframe era)
2. One person, one computer (PC era - "uneasy symbiosis")
3. Many computers, one person (ubiquitous era)

**The Philosophy**: Computers should **vanish into the background** and be **"as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods"** - not frustrating and attention-demanding.

### Are We There Yet?

**✅ What We've Achieved:**

1. **The devices exist**: Smartwatches (tabs), smartphones/tablets (pads), smart TVs (boards)
2. **Universal connectivity**: Wi-Fi and 5G everywhere
3. **Location awareness**: GPS in every pocket
4. **IoT everywhere**: Smart homes, voice assistants, connected appliances
5. **Invisible functions**: Contactless payments, cloud sync, automatic updates
6. **Multiple computers per person**: We interact with 10+ devices daily

**❌ What We're Missing:**

1. **SCREENS DEMAND TOO MUCH ATTENTION**
   - Weiser wanted calm, invisible computing
   - We got attention-extraction machines designed for "engagement"
   - More trapped by screens than ever (social media, notifications)
   - Technology is NOT calm

2. **PRIVACY NIGHTMARE**
   - Weiser warned: "hundreds of computers sensing people...have the potential to make totalitarianism seem sheerest anarchy"
   - This happened through corporate surveillance capitalism
   - Data breaches, tracking, loss of control
   - Can't opt out without losing functionality

3. **NO INTEROPERABILITY**
   - Apple vs. Google vs. Amazon walled gardens
   - Can't "grab any pad" like Weiser envisioned
   - Fragmented standards, manual setup required

4. **TECHNOLOGY IS STILL VISIBLE**
   - Constant charging, updating, managing
   - Notifications interrupt constantly
   - Error messages break the experience

5. **FAILED THE "WALK IN WOODS" TEST**
   - Should reduce information overload - instead increased it
   - Should be calming - instead causes anxiety
   - Should disappear - instead dominates attention

### The Fundamental Irony

We built the **technical infrastructure** (devices, networks, sensors) but **inverted the philosophy**:

| Weiser's Vision | What We Got |
|----------------|-------------|
| Calm technology | Attention economy |
| Serves individuals | Individuals serve platforms |
| Human-centered | Algorithm-centered |
| Invisible computing | Unavoidable screens |
| Reduces overload | Creates overload |

### What Needs to Happen

**Technical:**

- Energy harvesting (no charging)
- True edge computing (local processing)
- Universal open standards
- Natural interfaces (not screen-based)

**Social/Policy:**

- Privacy by design
- Data ownership rights
- Interoperability mandates
- Regulation of manipulative design
- Ethical AI frameworks

**Philosophical Shift:**

- From "engagement" to "enablement"
- From "personalization" to "privacy"
- From "smart" to "calm"
- Measure success by how quickly users accomplish goals, not time-on-platform

### Conclusion

**We're living in ubiquitous computing without the calm.**

We have the computers everywhere, but not the "refreshing walk in the woods" feeling. We got the devices but lost the vision. Weiser's paper wasn't just a technical prediction—it was a **moral vision** for how technology should enhance human life.

## LECTURE 12: Most Downloaded MR Apps (Future)
